         <p>Hunter × Hunter is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father.</p> </div>

    <p> Hunters (ハンター, Hantā) are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals. They can also access locations that regulars cannot access.[4] To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand.[5] A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars: a single star for making "remarkable achievements in a particular field"; they may then be upgraded to two stars for "holding an official position" and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for "remarkable achievements in multiple fields".</p>

            <p><b></b> Like something you might find in a typical newspaper but is vague enough not to contradict anything the writers have written so far or might want to write for later installments.They are classic paragraphs that have been used in multiple TV and movie productions. The newspaper has a headline, maybe a byline, a photo and usually a lead paragraph that is relevant to the story. </p>

                <p>Let me tell you that this cocktail is TASTY. The first few sips are like WHOA. It’s a bit on the strong side, but if you exploit the sugar rim you’ll be just fine. It definitely balances out the Sweet and citrus TANG.  After finishing the first drink, you’ll find the second one to be much smoother! We even did a little gin floater on top. Amazing. So won’t you make yourself a cocktail and have one with us?</p>
